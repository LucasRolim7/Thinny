# What is going to be my research topic?

Having researched deeper into the possibilities of [Digital Fabrication](https://www.opendesk.cc/about/digital-fabrication), I’ve seen the many different variables that can be used as data input to generate a Digital fabricated model. Perhaps one of the most useful tools in this sense is the Rhino Plugin grasshopper, that takes a broad range of parameters such as images, sounds, movement etc., and converts them in numerical outputs that will be used to generate the parametric model intended.
Following this line of thought, I have decided that the topic I want to explore is how to use this data input, that generally doesn’t translate into architecture so easily, into a parametric model using different fabrication tools in the process.
To be more specific, I decided to study how to transform movement – a dynamic variable – into data that will be converted in a spatial architectural and static object. My intention is to analyze the movement of athletes in sports to create the data and parametric design.

To reach my goal, two main procedures will be needed. The first is how to capture the movement and bring it to the digital environment. The second is how to use the data captured and translate it to a 3D parametric model.
To achieve the motion capture, I intend to use a technique known as optical motion capture, that only uses a camera (or more than one) and triangulates the movement a position of the object or person in the digital environment. Although usually this type of motion capture requires expensive cameras (more than one), there is a tool that although does not not have the motion capture as primary function, when associated with the proper software, it has an extreme power and is very precise. This tool is the [Xbox One Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect_for_Xbox_One), a camera used in association with the Microsoft videogame console to make gamers interact with the game being played in real time.

If connected with a computer, it can precisely capture the movement of one person and even facial expressions. There are some examples of people that have used the Kinect in association with [Rhino 3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/) and [Grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/) plugin to transfer the data captured by the Kinect into the 3D model. I intend to use the Kinect not only because is a precise tool, but also because can be used easily integrated with two software that I am already familiar (Rhino and Grasshopper).

Once I have successfully captured the movements I desire, I will translate the 3D coordinates of varied parts of the body to the computer. Then, the data collected need to be put in grasshopper to create the parametrical object. However, between collecting the data and using it grasshopper there are several steps of editing and treating the values to create a simple object. Lastly, the data in grasshopper needs to be carefully manipulated in order to create an architectural object but that still has a relation to the movement captured.
Although I do not master the motion capture technique neither how to convert it to 3D objects, I will use projects that have done similar propositions as references in order to facilitate the process and achieve a better result.

## Sources:

To understand more about the process of Motion Capture (MoCap),and how to apply it to architecture, I have read different sources such as the [Grasshopper Community Forum](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/video/video/listTagged?tag=Firefly), [Articles about MoCap, the kinect etc](http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/08/using-the-kinect-for-motion-capture/). Also one of the best sources I found is a Thesis which uses the dance movement and apply it to architecture. As it has a very similar purpose of my research, it will be one my primary sources of research. The name of the thesis is [_From Dance Movement
to Architectural Form_](http://opus.bath.ac.uk/27813/1/UnivBath_MPhil_2011_D_Stathopoulou.pdf) by Dimitra Stathopoulou from University of Bath.
